### Hello everyone

I have over a decade of experience in software development, primarily as a front-end developer, including two years as a full-stack developer and contributions to back-end development on various projects while fulfilling front-end responsibilities. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and am fluent in English.
I worked for the first time with machine learning (ML, AI) back in **2016**, diving deep into bioinformatics projects at FTMG, collaborating with Insilico Medicine (http://insilico.com) and build UI for one FinTech+AI project. 
Since 2019, I’ve been fully focused on web3 (blockchain), working with projects like [evmOS](https://github.com/evmos) and joined evmos even before mainnet launch, [Aeternity](https://github.com/aeternity), [BitSong](https://github.com/bitsongofficial), and not only. I have first-hand knowledge of multi-chain solutions. Know cryptography standards and specs. Aware of normative crypto regulations in various of countries.
