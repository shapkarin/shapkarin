I’m a Senior Frontend & Full-Stack Engineer with 10+ years in production development across Web,
Fintech and Web3. I build end-to-end solutions from architecture and implementation to performance,
security and CI/CD.

My experience includes multi-chain dApps, non-custodial (and custodial) wallets, SocialFi products
and high-load frontends using React, TypeScript, Next.js and Node.js. I work across EVM, Solana
and Cosmos ecosystems and contribute to system design and architectural decisions in fast-moving
product teams. I also have strong experience building large Web2 systems, high-load frontends and
secure enterprise-grade applications.

I care deeply about secure engineering: supply-chain protection (LavaMoat, pnpm safety features),
cryptographic standards and compliance-aware development for Web3/fintech environments.

Alongside hands-on engineering, I bring experience in technical leadership, mentoring and continuous
process improvement helping teams deliver cleaner architectures, better code quality and predictable
release cycles.
